This repo is made up of all of the projects and homework assignments that are assigned in COP1005.

You will see that each assignment is labled project # (the number representing its module).

The purpose of this respitory is so I can work on these projects with classmates and I can also help others by sharing the work I have done so instead of copying and pasteing in chat GPT, they can actually learn something.

||NOTE||
* There are lots of comments in each project, please read them so you can understand how the program works.
* If you have any wuestions, feel free to contact me. I will try to answer any questions as best as I can.
* Please NO NOT use this code as your own work.

Thanks for reading!
